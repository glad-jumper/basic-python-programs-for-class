Task 11
Modify the example to keep looping if the user types "y".

python
Copy code
keepGoing = "yes"
while keepGoing == "yes" or keepGoing == "y":
    print("Since the variable keepGoing is still 'yes' or 'y', I am going to keep going.")
    keepGoing = input("Do you want me to keep going? (yes/y to continue) ")
print("Ok, you typed something other than 'yes' or 'y', so I stopped.")

Task 12
The program continues looping if the user types "yes" or "y".

python
Copy code
keepGoing = "yes"
while keepGoing == "yes" or keepGoing == "y":
    print("Continuing.")

print("Ok, stopping.")

Task 13

while keepGoing in ["yes", "y"]:
    print("Continuing.")
    keepGoing = input("Do you want me to keep going? (yes/y to continue) ")
print("Ok, stopping.")

Task 14
The program loops until the user types "no" or "no thanks".

python
Copy code
keepGoing = "yes"
while keepGoing not in ["no", "no thanks"]:
    print("Continuing.")
    keepGoing = input("Do you want me to keep going? (no/no thanks to stop) ")
print("Ok, stopping.")
Task 14b
Using a break statement to stop the loop.

python
Copy code

        break

Task 15
The program loops if the user types "hey", "woo", or "yes".

python
Copy code
while True:
    print("Continuing.")
    keepGoing = input("Do you want me to keep going? (hey/woo/yes to continue) ")
    if keepGoing not in ["hey", "woo", "yes"]:
        print("Ok, stopping.")
        break

Task 16
The program continues looping if the user types anything other than "no".

python
Copy code
while True:
    print("Continuing.")

        break

Task 17
The program keeps going unless the user types "done", "quit", or "exit", case-insensitive.

python
Copy code
while True:
    print("Continuing.")
    keepGoing = input("Do you want me to keep going? (done/quit/exit to stop) ").lower()

        break

Task 18

python
Copy code

    if action == "add":
        count += 1
    elif action == "subtract":
        count -= 1
    elif action == "quit":
        print(f"Your final tally is {count}.")
